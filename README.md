Writing readable, extensible, and maintainable code can be difficult, but the tools provided within the scripts in this repository will make that a bit easier. Through my M.S. and Ph.D. I've written a ton of code, and I'm sure the large majority is *far* from perfect, but I've learned a lot in the process. In general, readable code is facilitated by:

1. Following a style guide
2. Commenting your code
3. Writing code that is self explanatory

The exercises within these R-Markdown files touch on all three of these points, but emphasize points 1 and 2 heavily. I created these exercises with information I wish I had when I was learning my first coding language, but this is far from exhaustive. Feel free to give these exercises a try, tell me what you think, and how these can be improved!
